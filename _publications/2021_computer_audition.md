We train a depthwise separable convolutional neural network on a challenging electronic dance music (EDM) data set and compare its performance to convolutional neural networks operating on both source separated and standard spectrograms. It is shown that source separation improves classification performance in a limited-data setting compared to the standard single spectrogram approach.}, number={18}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Mersy, Gabriel and Kuan, Jin Hong}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={15847-15848} }
