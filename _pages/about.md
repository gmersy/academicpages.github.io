I am a computer science PhD student in the [ChiData group](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/index.html) at [The University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sanjay Krishnan](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/sanjay-krishnan/). I did my undergrad at [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). I am working on the theory and practice of making data management and machine learning more environmentally sustainable. My work blends statistics, information theory, and mathematical optimization to reduce the carbon emissions associated with data.
