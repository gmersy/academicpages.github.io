I am a computer science PhD student in the [ChiData group](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/index.html) at [The University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sanjay Krishnan](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/sanjay-krishnan/). I did my undergrad at [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). 

Broadly, my current research focuses on developing systems that track and reduce carbon emissions throughout the life cycle of data. I also work on approximation techniques with error guarantees, such as lossy compression.
