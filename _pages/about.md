Welcome to my site.
======
I am a CS PhD student in the [ChiData group]([https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/sanjay-krishnan/](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/index.html) at [The University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sanjay Krishnan](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/sanjay-krishnan/). I hail from Minneapolis, Minnesota (ope!) and did my undergrad at [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). I am passionate about both the environmental and social impact of data science. My research is at the intersection of data systems, machine learning, and climate change/sustainability. My work aims to quantify the carbon emissions of certain types of data systems, as well as propose novel theoretically-grounded algorithms that can readily adapt to fluctuating electric grid carbon intensities.
