I am a computer science PhD student in the [ChiData group](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/index.html) at [The University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) working with [Sanjay Krishnan](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/sanjay-krishnan/). I graduated from the [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) in 2021 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. While there, I worked on computational social science, machine learning, and statistical sampling research.

Broadly, my current research focuses on developing systems that track and reduce carbon emissions throughout the life cycle of data. I also work on approximation techniques with error guarantees, such as lossy compression.
